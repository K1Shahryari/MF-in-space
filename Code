# Input values
I = float(input("Enter the electric current (in picoamperes): "))

# In this section, we have assumed the distance value to be 5000 nm or 5 µm (based on the paper data, reference #13)
r = float(input("Enter the distance from the neuron (in nanometers): "))

# Define the μ of space in T·m/A
mu_0 = 12.56 * 10**-7  # Value of μ₀ in T·m/A

# Convert units to Amperes and meters (to be suitable for the unit of measurement:  T·m/A)
I = I * 10**-12  # Convert picoamperes to Amperes
r = r * 10**-9  # Convert nanometers to meters

# Calculate the MF in Tesla
B = (mu_0 * I) / (2 * math.pi * r)

# Convert MF to femtotesla
B_femtotesla = B * 10**12

# Output the result
print("The MF (B) calculated is:", B_femtotesla, "femtotesla")
